### Testing Hardware Issues

B. Check for paper jams and remove if there is any.<br>
C. Check the cable connections. (The power cable and ethernet cables connected from your printer to your Wi-Fi router)<br>

B. Next, comfirm that your receipt printer and the Wi-Fi router are on the same subnet. On your receipt printer, print a network configuration report by following these steps:

<p>
<ol style="float:left; margin-left:1rem">
<li>Switch your printer OFF.</li>
<li>Hold down the <b>FEED</b> button located on the front of your printer</li>
<li>While holding the <b>FEED</b> button down, switch your printer ON.</li>
<li>The lights should flash for a few seconds. Wait for it to print.</li>
<li>Release the FEED button.</li>
</ol>
</p>
